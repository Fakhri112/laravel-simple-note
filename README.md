# Laravel Simple Note

_Basic CRUD App with authentication_

---

## About Project

My first project using Laravel as fullstack framework 😘😉

I made this project to understanding how Laravel development is work 🧐. The design pattern is predictable and understandable 🍨. I don't feel sweaty working with Laravel actually because i can easily manually configure the app whatever i want or let laravel set up for me with almost zero configuration.

I implement full authentication like basic sign in and sign up, reset password, and email verification 🔑 and of course i implement basic CRUD too for simple note App 📒

Thank You 😉
